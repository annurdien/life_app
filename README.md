# Life App
## Diary and Sleep Helper Apps

Life App is an app that I build for my last assignment for Mobile Apss Courses. I have this idea because sometimes I also 
have issue with my mental health. Esepecially in this pandemic situation when I cannot really hangout with 
all of my friends and being stucked in my home in front of my s**tty computer. To be honest I love building this apps not only because I need this apps but for most of it I just enjoy programming.

## Features

- Sleep helper
- Calm music player
- Gratitude journal
- Profile
- Google login supported

## Tech

Life App uses a number of open source projects to work properly:


- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) - Mobile Apps Framework
- [Riverpod](https://pub.dev/packages/riverpod) - State Management
- and more...

And of course Life App itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/annurdien/life_app)
 on GitHub.
